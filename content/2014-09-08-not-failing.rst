It turns out, the test I prepared earlier passes. So the reported issue needs a
bit more work. I wanted to avoid the data-set which reproduces the failure
because I'm lazy.

I should have known better.

So I will now do a similar manual step through the data-set as I did earlier...
This time, as the data is one-dimensional, I will need to find anotehr way to
visualise it. And I also think I will do that by manually writing an SVG file.
Clicking all that together with a mouse would be painful. Let's see where this
gets me...
