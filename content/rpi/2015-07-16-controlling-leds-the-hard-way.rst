Controlling Raspberry-Pi LEDs the Hard Way

Yesterday I finally got my hands on a multimeter and could read out resistor
values. As a colourblind person, I was unaware that this would bite me.

I decided to go ahead and play around with a simple schematic. The goal: Make
the LED light up as long as the button is pressed.

I decided to do all with a multiprocessed Python application. You know... for
funsies. But also because I am more of a software than a hardware guy.

To access the GPIOs, I'm using the excellent pigpio_ library.

The Challenge
=============

Write a Python application which uses multiple processes to react to external
stimuli.

Starting Point
==============

* Button connected to GPIO 7 (``CE1`` on the Ext. Board).
* LED connected to GPIO 8 (``CE0`` on the Ext. Board).

Plan of Action
==============

* Write three sub-processes (in addition to the main process):

  * One process, the "Button Monitor", which reacts to button presses by
    converting them into "Button State Change Events".
  * One process, the "LED Controller", which reacts to "LED State Change"
    events by converting them to GPIO signals.
  * One "Event Dispatch Process". This one combines all message queues and
    knows which events should be sent to which process.

Material Used
=============

* SunFounder Raspberry-Pi-GPIO Extension Board V2.2
* 1 kŒè Resistor
* 1 LED
* 1 Button
* 3 Jumper Wires
* 1 Bread Board

Wiring
======

I don't have anything to draw schematics yet... so a crappy potato photo will
have to do:

Now this is the amusing part. And too big to post here. The resulting code can
be found in my GitHub repository_.
