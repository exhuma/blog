I decided to do some exploration in *Elite: Dangerous*, and I figured out that
I need to keep some notes. The game is too vast.

I finally got my :ed-term:`Detailed Surface Scanner` and to me this is what I
was waiting for before beginning the journey. Once I equipped my :ed-term:`Fuel
Scoop` I will head out to :ed-system:`Coalsack`

    Coalsack

As a personal note: My starting system was :ed-system:`LHS 3447`, and my
current "base of operations" is :ed-system:`BD+23 2640`.

As the galaxy map only calculates routes so far, I will have to settle for an
intermediate stop at system :ed-system:`Wilingura`.

Everything's set. Let's go!


Notes
-----

* Both the :ed-term:`Intermediate Discovery Scanner` and the :ed-term:`Advanced
  Discovery Scanner` can be bought on *Reynolds Hub* in :ed-system:`LTT 4772
  B2`.

* I should go back to :ed-system:`Hydrae Sector CQ-Y B4 A`. Was unable to find
  the third star.
