After turning in for the night in :ed-system:`BD-22 3573` the journey
continues. This is actually really close to :ed-system:`Wilingura` so I'll skip
that checkpoint and the next aim will be :ed-system:`Daesitiates`.

Notes
-----

* In :ed-system:`Kokosh`, I managed to find a planet simply by "feeling
  out" the gravity while travelling towards the second star. I missed it on the
  first scan as it was well out of range of the basic disco scanner. I really
  need a better one.
