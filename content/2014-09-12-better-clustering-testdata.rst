Better Testdata for HClustering
===============================

While I first intended to create the matrices manually, it
turned out to take too much time if I wanted to reproduce the exact same error
as happened in the unit-tests.

So in order to create the matrices used in the earlier blog-posts, I used the
script at the end of this article. I took care to double-check the results
however. There are times, where there's a choice of more than one cluster to
pick. And as the order is not important, this choice becomes dependent on the
concrete implementation, and thus non-deterministic in the unit-tests. This
caused a discrepancy in the matrices generated by the script below, and the
current implementation of the algorithm in library. If that was the case, I
validated the results manually, and they checked out.

Unfortunately though, the data in the existing unit-test do not provoke a
difference between *UCLUS* and *average* linkage (there are no real
*outliers*).  Which is unfortunate. I will (for now) *not* create a new
data-set to verify the difference between *UCLUS* and *average*. I trust the
current implementation enough to say that it will do the right thing...

Finally, here's the script used to create the test-data:

.. include:: code-samples/2014-09-14-clustertest-helper.py
    :code: python
