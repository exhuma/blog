Blogging in reStructured Text
=============================

I have always been quite a big fan of `reStructured Text`_ Text as markup
format. It's easy to write and supports a lot of different text roles. It's not
a lot more difficult than Markdown_ but can do a lot more. I always thought it
was a great blogging "platform". So I went searching, and found Pelican_ as
static site generator. I have been playing around with it now for two days and
am impressed so far!

To me the two biggest highlights are:

* Publishing from the shell and
* Tracking articles `via git`_

As ``git`` is a very viable option, publishing via hooks becomes a very nead
possibility as well. For now, I'm handling it with fabric_, and I don't see the
immediate need to publish via hooks.
