Day 1
-----

I decided to do some exploration in *Elite: Dangerous*, and I figured out that
I need to keep some notes. The game is too vast.

I finally got my :ed-term:`Detailed Surface Scanner` and to me this is what I
was waiting for before beginning the journey. Once I equipped my :ed-term:`Fuel
Scoop` I will head out to :ed-system:`Coalsack`

    Coalsack

As a personal note: My starting system was :ed-system:`LHS 3447`, and my
current "base of operations" is :ed-system:`BD+23 2640`.

As the galaxy map only calculates routes so far, I will have to settle for an
intermediate stop at system :ed-system:`Wilingura`.

Everything's set. Let's go!


Notes
~~~~~

* Both the :ed-term:`Intermediate Discovery Scanner` and the :ed-term:`Advanced
  Discovery Scanner` can be bought on *Reynolds Hub* in :ed-system:`LTT 4772
  B2`.

* I should go back to :ed-system:`Hydrae Sector CQ-Y B4 A`. Was unable to find
  the third star.

Day 2
-----

After turning in for the night in :ed-system:`BD-22 3573` the journey
continues. This is actually really close to :ed-system:`Wilingura` so I'll skip
that checkpoint and the next aim will be :ed-system:`Daesitiates`.

Notes
~~~~~

* In :ed-system:`Kokosh`, I managed to find a planet simply by "feeling
  out" the gravity while travelling towards the second star. I missed it on the
  first scan as it was well out of range of the basic disco scanner. I really
  need a better one.

Day 3
-----

Well shucks... :ed-system:`Daesitiates` is pretty much a fringe system. No
population behind that point and my equipment is not self-sufficient enough to
continue. Time to head back to friendly space. :ed-system:`Chemaku`, here I
come...

Day 4
-----

* The :ed-term:`Asp` is available in :ed-system:`Nyanktona`
